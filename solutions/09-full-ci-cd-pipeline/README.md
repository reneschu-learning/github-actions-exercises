# Solution: Exercise 9 - Full CI/CD Pipeline

This solution demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a .NET application with multiple stages, matrix strategies, and environment deployments.

## Files
- `ci-cd-pipeline.yml`: Complete CI/CD pipeline workflow
- The sample application is located in the exercise directory

## Pipeline Overview

### ðŸ”¨ Build and Test Job
- **Matrix Strategy**: Tests against .NET 8.0 and 9.0
- **Actions Used**: `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-dotnet@v4`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- **Process**: Checkout â†’ Setup .NET â†’ Restore â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Upload artifacts
- **Artifacts**: Build outputs and test results for each .NET version
- **Features**: 
  - Unit test execution with xUnit
  - Test result collection in TRX format
  - Code coverage collection
  - Test result artifacts upload

### ðŸ“¦ Package Job
- **Dependencies**: Requires build job
- **Condition**: Only runs on non-PR events
- **Actions Used**: `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-dotnet@v4`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- **Process**: 
  - Downloads build artifacts
  - Publishes application for deployment
  - Creates deployment package with metadata

### ðŸš€ Deploy Jobs

#### Development Deployment
- **Triggers**: Main branch pushes or manual dispatch
- **Environment**: Uses GitHub Environments
- **Actions Used**: `actions/download-artifact@v4`
- **Features**:
  - Environment URL configuration
  - Build information display
  - Deployment summary in GitHub interface (`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`)

#### Production Deployment
- **Dependencies**: Requires development deployment
- **Conditions**: Manual production selection
- **Actions Used**: `actions/setup-dotnet@v4`, `actions/download-artifact@v4`
- **Features**:
  - Environment URL configuration
  - Build information display
  - Running the application
  - Release tag creation using GitHub REST API

### ðŸ“¢ Notification Job
- **Dependencies**: Runs after deployment jobs
- **Condition**: Always runs if any deployment occurred
- **Features**: Status notifications for all environments

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Job Dependencies
```yaml
needs: [ deploy-dev, deploy-prod ]
```
Controls execution order and ensures stages run only after prerequisites.

### 2. Matrix Strategies
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    dotnet-version: ['8.0.x', '9.0.x']
```
Build and tests across multiple .NET versions in parallel.

### 3. Conditional Execution
```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```
Controls when deployments occur based on branch and triggers.

### 4. Artifact Management
- Build artifacts shared between jobs
- Test results preserved for analysis
- Deployment packages with metadata
- Retention policies for storage optimization

### 5. Environment Integration
- Environment-specific configurations
- Protection rules support
- Environment URLs for easy access
- Manual approval workflows (when configured)

### 6. GitHub Actions Features
- Step summaries for deployment status
- Emoji usage for better readability
- Realistic timing with sleep commands
- Comprehensive logging and status reporting

## Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main**: Full pipeline with development deployment
- **Pull Request**: Build and test only (no deployment)

### Manual Trigger
- **Workflow Dispatch**: 
  - Environment selection (development/production)
  - Full pipeline execution
  - Manual production deployments

## Environment Setup
To use this pipeline effectively:

1. Create GitHub Environments:
   - `development`: For automatic deployments
   - `production`: With protection rules and approvals

2. Configure Environment Variables (if using Exercise 8 setup):
   - Repository variables for global configuration
   - Environment-specific variables

3. Set up Branch Protection:
   - Require PR reviews for main branch
   - Require status checks to pass

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each job has a single responsibility and clear purpose.

### 2. Fail Fast
Tests run early to catch issues before deployment.

### 3. Artifact Efficiency
Only necessary files are included in artifacts with appropriate retention.

### 4. Security
- No hardcoded secrets
- Environment-based access control
- Minimal permission requirements

### 5. Observability
- Comprehensive logging
- Status summaries
- Clear job naming with emojis
- Deployment metadata tracking

### 6. Scalability
- Matrix strategies for multi-version support
- Modular job structure
- Reusable patterns

This pipeline provides a solid foundation that can be extended with these additional capabilities as needed.
